                This is the very first post to my programming blog.
                I started this blog to document the various projects and lessons
                I've learned and hopefully prevent both myself and others
                from falling into the same pitfalls.

                Starting with this website
                I personally found it suprisingly
                easy to set up the basics.
                This blog is going to be hosted
                on github pages and I plan to keep
                the site pure static html.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also want to mention I used
                w3schools as both reference and learning resource.
            </p>

                Going forward I want to add entries about Vulkan, and OpenGL.
                Personally speaking I don't plan to do much frontend web dev
                but its good to have a website anyways to show that you could if
                you had to.
            </p>

                Anyways I am probably the only person who will read this so
                good on me. Next post will be on the GPU pipeline.
